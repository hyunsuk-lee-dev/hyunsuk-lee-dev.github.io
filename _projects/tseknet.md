Dan implemented a lot of features I want to ship with Hydejack sometime, such as

- Last updated field for posts
- Estimated reading time
- Colorful callouts (known as "notes" or "messages" in Hydejack)
- Click to copy code block (coming in 9.1 ðŸ¤ž)
- A more privacy and user friendly comment system than Disqus...

As Dan's site shows, you don't have to wait for me to ship these features in generalized form, you can just add them to your site in a way that works for you!
